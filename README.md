# IntelliJ Key Bindings

Port of IntelliJ key bindings for VS Code. Migration was originally done in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/webartoli/de2d33fd193937e7512a) by [webartoli](https://github.com/webartoli).
Current implementation is for Resharper 9. 

## TODO

- Port more key bindings
- Support other versions of Resharper / IntelliJ products (could be as a separate extension or as a command).
